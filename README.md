# Unofficial Simple And Rough Implementation Of AnyText  |  [中文说明](./AnyText/assets/README-Zh-CN.md)

## Original Repo: [AnyText: Multilingual Visual Text Generation And Editing](https://github.com/tyxsspa/AnyText)

## For personal reason Suspended maintenance.

## Warning: 
- I'm not a coder, so many issues i have no idea how to solve.
- **Do not install modelscope & tensorflow packages if `damo/nlp_csanmt_translation_zh2en` translator not needed!!!**
- This custom-node results maybe worse than official. 
- Tested only on **cuda with fp16/fp32** , you can try others options but maybe not work.
- Tested with **Official_ComfyUI_Stable_Release** using **python_embed** on **windows** in my case. Distributions from unofficial or vitural env or other OS(such as linux) maybe not work.
- Tensorflow need specified cuda_version to run on gpu, but on native windows [tensorflow 2.10+: look at the note](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.11.1) will not work on cuda, we need linux or wsl2 to make gpu work. In this case, `damo/nlp_csanmt_translation_zh2en` translator will run slowly on cpu.
- If error `Input type (torch.cuda.FloatTensor) and weight type (torch.FloatTensor) should be the same` raise, try set **all_to_device** to true, maybe works. Thanks to **@[602387193c](https://github.com/602387193c)**----->**[issues/17](https://github.com/zmwv823/ComfyUI-AnyText/issues/17)**.
- If error `expected scalar type Half but found Float`, try fp32.
### v2 test, more native, not remote_code mode.

## Instructions:
- `utrobinmv/t5_translate_en_ru_zh_small_1024` (212MB) is faster and smaller, but accurancy is far worse than `damo/nlp_csanmt_translation_zh2en`(7.3GB).
- Input_prompts will be checked if is_Chinese_prompts to decide whether auto load translator or not.
- Numbers of draw_masks must >= nunbers of string_content (in the "") we want to generate, or it will raise an error ["not enough values to unpack"](https://github.com/zmwv823/ComfyUI-AnyText/issues/7).
- works on my pc: ComfyUI official release+(ComfyUI_windows_portable\ComfyUI)start with powershell+python_embed+win10+py311+torch2.3.0+cu121+rtx3050laptop(4GB).
- pillow>=9.5.0(10.3.0) Most packages are the newest.
- **Accept any resolution image input, but will resized to <=768, output images will limited to <=768.(Official method)** 
- **If font、ckpt_name、clip、translator set to Auto_DownLoad, default models will automtically download to specified directory. Models will loaded if models already exist.**
- AnyText model will download into "ComfyUI\models\checkpoints\15\anytext_v1.1.safetensors" from huggingface(fp16: 2.66 GB).
- We can manually download [AnyText-FP32-5.73 GB](https://modelscope.cn/models/iic/cv_anytext_text_generation_editing/file/view/master?fileName=anytext_v1.1.ckpt&status=2) from modelscope,(fp32 5.73 GB).Then put it into **ComfyUI\models\checkpoints**.
- Or manually download [AnyText-FP16-2.66 GB](https://huggingface.co/Sanster/AnyText/blob/main/pytorch_model.fp16.safetensors) from huggingface and rename it to **anytext_v1.1.safetensors or whatever you like**.Then put it into **ComfyUI\models\checkpoints**.
- clip model [**clip-vit-large-patch14**](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14) will download into `C:\Users\username\.cache\huggingface\hub`. We can manually download all files from [clip_model](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14) into **ComfyUI\models\clip\openai--clip-vit-large-patch14**.
- ![](./AnyText/assets/clip_model.jpg)
- [Font-(SourceHanSansSC-Medium.otf)-18MB](https://huggingface.co/Sanster/AnyText/blob/main/SourceHanSansSC-Medium.otf) will download into **ComfyUI\models\fonts** from huggingface, we can use any other fonts too.
- Translator model [huggingface--utrobinmv/t5_translate_en_ru_zh_small_1024-212MB](https://huggingface.co/utrobinmv/t5_translate_en_ru_zh_small_1024) will download into `C:\Users\username\.cache\huggingface\hub` or  [modelscope--damo\nlp_csanmt_translation_zh2en--7.3GB](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/iic/nlp_csanmt_translation_zh2en) will download into `C:\Users\username\.cache\modelscope\hub\damo`. We can maually download translator model from link before, then put all files into `ComfyUI\models\prompt_generator\models--utrobinmv--t5_translate_en_ru_zh_small_1024` or `ComfyUI\models\prompt_generator\nlp_csanmt_translation_zh2en`.

- **The AnyText model itself is also a standard sd1.5 text2image model.**
## Example Prompts:
### Text-Generation English Prompts:
- An exquisite mug with an ancient Chinese poem engraved on it, including  “花落知多少” and “夜来风雨声” and “处处闻啼鸟” and “春眠不觉晓”
- Sign on the clean building that reads “科学” and "과학"  and "ステップ" and "SCIENCE"
- An ice sculpture is made with the text "Happy" and "Holidays".Dslr photo.
- A baseball cap with words “要聪明地” and “全力以赴”
- A nice drawing of octopus, sharks, and boats made by a child with crayons, with the words “神奇海底世界”
### Text-Editing English Prompts:
- A Minion meme that says "wrong"
- A pile of fruit with "UIT" written in the middle

- 一个建筑物前面的字母标牌， 上面写着 " "
## Example workflow:
![workflow](./AnyText/assets/AnyText-wf.png)

## Some Params:

### sort_radio: order to draw text.

- ↕ for y axis. It will draw text-content("string") from start-to-end(order) on the mask position from top to bottom.
- ↔ for x axis .It will draw text-content("string") from start-to-end(order) on the mask position from left to right.

### revise_pose: correct text position(only works in gen-mode).

- Which uses the bounding box of the rendered text as the revised position. However, it is occasionally found that the creativity of the generated text is slightly lower using this method, It dosen't work in text-edit mode.

### Random_Gen: automatic generate mask.

- Automatically generate mask based on the number of text-content("string"). With this checked the manual_draw mask dosen't work.

### nonEdit_random_gen_width & nonEdit_random_gen_height:

- For image size control with **text-generation and Random_Gen** together, works only in this situation.

### cpu_offload:

- For multi-turn generation, it will speed up a lot. But we need to turn it off and run once when this node is no more needed and with other process for deleting model from cpu(ram). If single generation, just turn it off.
